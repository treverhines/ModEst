ModEst - Model estimation package for inverse problems

The flagship function for this package is modest.nllstsq.nonlin_lstsq,
which is a nonlinear least-squares solver.  It performs the same
operations as scipy.optimize.curve_fit and includes a great of
regularization options.  See the documentation for nonlin_lstsq for
more information
