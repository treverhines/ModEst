ModEst - Model estimation package for inverse problems

The flagship function for this package is modest.nllstsq.nonlin_lstsq,
which is a nonlinear least-squares solver.  It performs the same
operations as scipy.optimize.curve_fit and includes a great deal of
regularization options.  See the documentation for nonlin_lstsq for
more information

This package also includes a package for generating a Tikhonov
regularization matrix based on connectivity of model parameters and it
includes a Kalman filtering class.  There is currently little
documentation for these features.

Install ModEst with the shell command "python setup.py install"
